# Project Rules — Shared Best Practices

These rules are intended as general, project‑agnostic foundations for healthy, maintainable software work. Apply them to any repository, library, or automated agent that contributes to the codebase.

## Rule 1 — Commit Early, Commit Often
Make small, frequent commits with clear, descriptive messages. Keep each commit focused and atomic so changes are easy to review, bisect, and revert if needed. Use feature branches for larger work and rebase/squash as appropriate before merging.

Why: Frequent, well‑scoped commits are the best checkpoints for development and debugging.

## Rule 2 — Understand the System Before Changing It
Before implementing new features or large changes, take the time to understand the architecture, data flow, and dependencies. Read the relevant code and tests, consult existing documentation, and ask teammates or open an issue if something is unclear.

Why: Changes made without context risk introducing bugs and technical debt.

## Rule 3 — Run Checks Before Committing or Deploying
Always run tests, linters, type checks, security scans, and any project‑specific validations locally (and rely on CI) before merging or deploying. For systems interacting with external services (e.g., trading, infra), include simulation or staging runs as part of validation.

Why: Automated and manual checks catch regressions early and protect production systems.

## Rule 4 — Break Work Into Small, Testable Steps
Split large tasks into smaller subtasks or incremental PRs that can be reviewed and validated independently. Use feature flags or staged rollouts for risky changes.

Why: Smaller steps reduce review overhead, make testing easier, and lower risk.

## Rule 5 — Documentation Policy: No Useless or Redundant Markdown
- All maintained project documentation must live under the docs/ directory (or another clearly designated docs location agreed on by the team).
- Do not create one‑off, duplicate, or gratuitous markdown files outside the docs/ directory.
- Avoid automatically generating repetitive recaps, summaries, or multiple near‑duplicate documents. Every doc must have a clear purpose and owner.
- Automated agents (including any AI assistants) are explicitly required to follow this policy. Agents must:
  - Only create or update documentation inside docs/.
  - Verify that new documentation is not redundant with existing docs.
  - Add a short rationale to the PR describing why the documentation is needed.
  - Respect linter/CI checks that block markdown outside docs/ or bulk autogenerated docs.

Why: Uncontrolled generation of markdown creates noise, increases maintenance cost, and dilutes important documentation.

Enforcement: Treat this policy as mandatory. CI checks and repository rules should be configured to:
- Fail builds or block merges that add markdown outside docs/ without an approved exception.
- Flag large numbers of autogenerated docs for manual review.
- Revert or remove documentation commits that violate the policy, and document the reason in the PR.

Following these rules helps keep projects reliable, reviewable, and efficient to maintain. When in doubt, ask a teammate or open an issue to propose exceptions rather than creating ad hoc files.
